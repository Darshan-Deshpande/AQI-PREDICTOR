The idea of the project is to help the environmentalists by predicting the air quality index of four major pollutants so that they can plan their campaign or can take action early to control the pollution accordingly.

DATA - The website used is - AQS API AIR DATA US (https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/data_api.html)
